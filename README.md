# Neurobit Technologies

This project entails creating multiple pages following a wireframe design. The File Upload Page allows file uploads and navigation. The Channel Configuration/Map Channels Page fetches JSON to create a channel selection form. The Preview Page displays and edits channel configurations. The Save Page locks edits and displays a notification. Context/Redux and local storage manage data, while responsiveness ensures a seamless experience on various devices.





## Features

- Settings stored in localStorage for persistent retrieval after browser closure or refresh
- Global state managed with Redux for cleaner, prop-free codebase.
- Channels data fetched from local JSON for dynamic row generation.
- Web app design based on Figma wireframe for consistent visual implementation.
